# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Yizhi Zhou**, a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at George Mason University (GMU)](https://ece.gmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xuan Wang](https://mason.gmu.edu/~xwang64/).  
My research lies at the intersection of **robotics, SLAM, multi-robot systems, and state estimation**, with applications in autonomous navigation and control.  

ðŸ”¬ I work on:  
- **Multi-sensor fusion** (IMU, camera, LiDAR, UWB)  
- **Distributed cooperative localization**  
- **NeRF / 3D Gaussian Splattingâ€“aided SLAM**  
- **Reinforcement learning for quadruped locomotion and loco-manipulation**  

ðŸŽ“ Previously, I received my M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/), advised by [Prof. Wei Ren](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~ren/), where I focused on **sensor fusion and drone localization**.  
I have also gained research and industry experience at [Rawmantic AI](https://youmi-zym.github.io/) and the [University at Buffalo](https://sairlab.org/).  

ðŸš€ My goal is to advance **autonomous robotic systems** by developing **robust, consistent, and scalable localization, perception, and control algorithms** for real-world applications.
