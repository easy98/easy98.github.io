I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at George Mason University (GMU), specializing in robotics, multi-agent
system, SLAM, visual-inertial odometry, and state estimation. I am passionate about developing trustworthy and autonomous
robot systems, which are (1) robust and adaptable, capable of operating over extended periods without human intervention
in dynamic and uncertain environments; (2) scalable and distributed that operates robustly and efficiently for the
localization, perception, and control of large-scale robot systems. My goal is to advance autonomous robotic systems by
developing reliable localization, control, and perception algorithms to achieve highly capable and intelligent robots in
real-world applications.
